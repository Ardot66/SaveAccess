# SaveAccess (C#)

SaveAccess is a system for easily saving data to text files in a JSON format. <br/> <br/>
Features Include: <br/>
 - Saving entire scene trees.
 - Automatic JSON serialization.
 - Support for recursive save structures.
 - ISaveable interface to allow modular save/load structures.

# Classes

This plugin consists of 3 central parts: (all are located under the Ardot.SaveSystems namespace) <br/>
- SaveAccess (used to save ISaveable nodes and SaveData to files) <br/>
- SaveData (used to store and move data to and from ISaveable objects) <br/>
- ISaveable (used by SaveAccess to interface with nodes and objects that need to be saved) <br/>

Together, these allow entire scenes of ISaveable nodes to be saved in just a few lines of code. <br/>

For more information, see the code documentation.

# Example

You have a node, 'Player'. You need to save its position. This is its code:

``` C#
public partial class Player : Node2D
{
	public override void _Process()
	{
		//Movement stuff here
	}
}
```

To make it save, you would need to set it up like this. (this is using the ISaveable default implementation template)

``` C#
using Ardot.SaveSystems;

public partial class Player : Node2D, ISaveable
{
	public override void _Process(double delta)
	{
		//Movement stuff here
	}
  
	public SaveData Save(params Variant[] parameters)
	{
		//Create and return a new SaveData with its key as GetLoadKey(), and its first value as GlobalPosition
		return new SaveData(GetLoadKey(), GlobalPosition); 
	}   
	
	public void Load(SaveData data, params Variant[] parameters)
	{
		//Checking if data is null, in case something went wrong.
		if(data == null)
		  return;

		//Setting GlobalPosition to the first value of data, as a Vector2
		GlobalPosition = data[0].AsVector2();
	}
	
	public StringName GetLoadKey(params Variant[] parameters)
	{
		//Returning the LoadKey as 'Player'. It's important that this is unique, otherwise data can be confused
		//If there were going to be more than one player, we may want this key to include some other identifier, like the node's path
		return "Player";
	}
}
```

Now, all you would need to save the player would be to have some script that creates a SaveAccess and runs SaveTree().
 
``` C#
public partial class SceneRootNode : Node2D
{
	public void SaveScene()
	{
		SaveAccess saveAccess = SaveAccess.Open("user://Save.txt");

		saveAccess.SaveTree(this);
		saveAccess.Commit();
	}
}
```

# Advanced Example

Now, imagine that Player has an inventory. This inventory is a Resource with ISaveable implemented. It won't be automatically saved like nodes, because it isn't directly included in the scene tree. <br/>

What you can do is set up Player to save and load its inventory by including the inventory's SaveData in the player's SaveData.

``` C#
using Ardot.SaveSystems;

public partial class Player : Node2D, ISaveable
{
	public Inventory playerInventory;

	public override void _Process(double delta)
	{
		//Movement stuff here
	}
  
	public SaveData Save(params Variant[] parameters)
	{
		//Create and return a new SaveData with its key as GetLoadKey(), its first value as GlobalPosition,
		//and its second value as playerInventory's SaveData
		return new SaveData(GetLoadKey(), GlobalPosition, playerInventory.Save());
	}   
	
	public void Load(SaveData data, params Variant[] parameters)
	{
		//Checking if data is null, in case something went wrong.
		if(data == null)
		  return;

		//Setting GlobalPosition to the first value of data, as a Vector2
		GlobalPosition = data[0].AsVector2();

		//Loading playerInventory with the second value of data, which is SaveData
		playerInventory.Load(data[1]);
	}
	
	public StringName GetLoadKey(params Variant[] parameters)
	{
		//Returning the LoadKey as 'Player'. It's important that this is unique, otherwise data can be confused
		//If there were going to be more than one player, we may want this key to include some other identifier, like the node's path
		return "Player";
	}
}
```
